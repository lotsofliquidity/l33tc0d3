Problem: Sliding Window Maximum (LeetCode 239)
Chapter: Monotonic
Source: course article (monotonic — a monotonic decreasing deque of indices; the
front is the window maximum, and it is dropped once it falls out of the window).

Companion file: none yet — there is no practice attempt for this problem.
